This new version requires now a domain. Please remove and reinstall the app or run the following command (donâ€™t forget to adapt 
`mqtt.example.com` with your real domain and `/example` with the desired path (it can be `/`)) and then launch the upgrade.

```
yunohost app setting mosquitto domain -v mqtt.example.com
yunohost app setting mosquitto path -v /example
```
